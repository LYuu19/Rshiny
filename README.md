# Rshiny
These are the shiny apps I made in the 8-weeks summer internship from the Mathematical School of the University of Nottingham. 
They are aimed at helping distance learning students to understand basic statistics knowledge.
As I was in distance learning last year due to the Covid-19, I believe this project is meaningful in improving the learning expirence of distance learning students.

Many thanks to the generous help from Dr. Severn and Dr. CaveyðŸ˜Š.
